/**
 * Container With Most Water
 * - You are given an array height where height[i] represents the height of the vertical line at index i.
 * - You need to find the two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water.
 * - The objective is to maximize the area of water the container can hold.
 * @description
 * - Initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the array respectively.
 * - Calculate the area formed between the two lines pointed by the pointers.
 * - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line inward (either left++ or right--) since moving the taller line wonâ€™t increase the area.
 * - Repeat this process until the two pointers meet, keeping track of the maximum area.
